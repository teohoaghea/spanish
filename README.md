spanish
=======

When I've started learning spanish I didn't like any of the applications which were available. 

I've started using Duolingo. It was a pleasure to use at first but it becomes dreadful to use at some point. Because you get frustrated when you have a mistake or you can't remember a simple word you've learnt at the beginning of the lesson. 

Each one of them took out any type of control I had over my learning. I didn't know how well I am progressing or if I'm any good at speaking this language.

I'm now in Spain and I can't speak Spanish yet. 

Everybody creating an application to help in language learning talks about **FUN**. Language learning should be fun, etc, etc. Each person has fun in different ways, there's nothing standard. Some people play Starcraft 2, others Warcraft 3 ... I think language learning should be about discovery.
